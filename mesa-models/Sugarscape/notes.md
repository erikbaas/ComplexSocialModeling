#Thoughts on this pollution model:

###With/Out Replacement Rule
    -Agents clear out niches, have no need to push beyond that, because they can just alternate.
    -Because they never go into other polluted squares, whole may stays relatively polluted.
    -When you introduce new agents to random spots, they have incentive to clear out the majority of the squares, and piles actually get pushed out to the badlands

###With/Out Growth-affecting pollution
    -When pollution affects growth, you have agents entering these pollution-heavy spots once they've fully grown.
    -In that way, you could hope that the big piles would get pushed out farther to the badlands, instead of staying stuck in the cities.
    -This also functions as an almost incentive to go and clear out polluted spots. Is there a different way to do this?
    -The only question is then is the one below.
###With Agent Pushing to amenity/pollution
    -When amenity is decided based on pollution, then it doesn't matter.
    -However, when pollution simply affects growth, amenity only correlates to sugar, so it doesn't make sense to use that. Instead, it makes more sense to push towards pollution-heavy sites.

##Next thoughts:
    -Agents need to spend 1/2 of wealth to be able to push pollution around.
    -That gives a nice benefit to the richer ones. Better mimics society.

##In the center, with proper regrowth formula and amenity=sugar, agents need to keep moving and cleaning because other agents throw shit into their territory for a time. Almost always still a dump in center

##The stronger the impact of pollution, the less space gets cleared out

##With replacement, pollution increase is linear
##Without replacement, curves off

##With better agents, do I get better results?


#Sweep
amount they can expend
expenditure scaling
initial pollution
Agent wealth distribution  correlating with total wealth
Mobility, who is doing the pushing

#Stabilization
There is a natural stabilization of wealth because of agent death and replacement
Stabilization is higher when there is less initial pollution
Stabilization is higher the less of their wealth agents can spend.

#Stepping Out
To different pollution model.
Different metric.
Different ratios


# Less agents makes it better. Everything is trending towards a libertarian view

# Looks like if we can make it possible for an agent to clean 2*pollution with the resources he used to make them, then it's more efficient for them to actually try and clean it
