Sugarscape Q's

For each chapter, think of questions I'd want to ask, ways I'd like to change the model. Then when I've got Mathematica/Netlogo working, I should go back and work through.

What happens when you have less desirable but closer sugar peaks?

How can you implement a tax to redistribute wealth. Proportional/brackets/progressive. Just how much is neccessary to reduce inequality?

Can a specific culture become marginalized based on initial conditions of the model?
